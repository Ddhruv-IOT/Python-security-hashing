# Python-security-hashing
<br>
Project for ShapeAi Bootcamp in python and network security.
<br><br>
I have created this project to demonstrate the use MD5 from hashlib. 
<br><br>
I have demonstrated various other algorithms used in hashing from Hashlib like:
<br><br>
  <pre>
  <br> SHA-1 
  <br> SHA-224
  <br> SHA-256
  <br> SHA-512
  </pre>
<br>
Also, added Salting and Iteration to Hash for increase security and protection.
